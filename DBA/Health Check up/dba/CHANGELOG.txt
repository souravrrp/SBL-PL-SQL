21-Aug-2005:
	- Fixed the bug that caused tablespaces with no free space not
      to show in "Free Space" screen (Files & Tablespace page)
	- Fixed the bug that prevented execution plans in 10g from showing
      when SQL was accessed through "Expensive SQL" page.
05-Sep-2005
    Version 1.0.1
    - Added masks to change passwords or lock accounts to the "Security"
      menu
    - Both system and session stats can now be filtered by patterns, ie.
      only statistics with names conforming to the entered patterns will
      be selected. Pattern search is case insensitive.
24-Sep-2005
    - Added two entries to Get DDL menu which sport script generation
      for public synonyms and various object types.
    - Added longops to the session info. 
27-Nov-2005
    Version 1.0.3
    - Pattern filtering added for Get DDL menus.
    - Show Connection is now a sub-menu which contains entries
      to change NLS_DATE_FORMAT and to show PHP info.
    - Instance menu contains several new entries: undo statistics,
      fixed view and dictionary view descriptions.
    - Files and tablespaces menu now has an entry which generates
      "create database" statement for the given database. That was
      inspired by Orac_DBA tool, now defunct, which was written in
      Perl, by Andy Duncan and Jared Still.
    - README.txt was fixed.
31-Dec-2005
    - Undo statistics doesn't show negative entries any more,
      it only shows entries that actually make sense.
    - SQL Worksheet no longer needs to have OutParameter binding in a
      loop, OCI8 bug was fixed in PHP 5.1.1  and ADOdb 4.68. Also,
      SQL entry window width was increased from 60 characters to 65.
    - Multiple privileges/roles can now be granted at once. The "select"
      box now can support multiple choices.
    - The "Instance" menu entry split to "Instance" and "Misc" for
      manageability.
    - CBO CPU Stats entry added to the instance menu. It queries
      SYS.AUX_STATS$
    - Version change to 1.0.4 
01-Jan-2006
    - Added are two menu entries for expensive SQL.  Statements can now be 
      sorted by executions and rows processed in addition to the CPU, elapsed 
      time or read requests.
    - Scripts that grant privileges can now both grant and revoke privileges.
    - Pattern matching was added to "Misc Info" menu, so that tables fitting 
      the criteria can now be searched for an individual owner or a group of
      owners. Affected scripts are the scripts for detecting tables with
      non-indexed foreign keys, fragmented objects and the largest objects.
    - Two menu items added to "Misc Info" menu: Table without a PK and table
      with no indexes. Pattern lookup for an individual owner is now an 
      option.
    - Version change to 1.0.5 
06-Jan-2006
      Removed dependency on PEAR Date class. 
11-Feb-2006
    - Killing session now requires confirmation.
    - Sessions menu contains new entry, which sorts sessions
      by the usage of undo blocks. This can be used to monitor
      progress of the rollback operations.
    - SGA statistics in the instance menu was renamed to "memory
      statistics" as it also shows PGA statistics.
    - Misc menu now contains searching through alert log. ALERT_LOG is
      an external table and the new SQL script needed to create it was
      added to the installation set.
    - Version change to 1.0.6
20-Mar-2006
    - Two new menu entries are added to the "Misc" menu. They show
      hottest segments from the database with respect to read and
      writes. This information is extracted from V$SEGMENT_STATISTICS
    - Pattern matching for free space report was added. It is useful
      for databases with lots of tablespaces.
    - SQL Worksheet can is now restricted to certain number of lines,
      configurable within the "Connection" menu. This was done to prevent
      queries which return lots of rows from completely devouring memory
      consumed by the httpd processes. At present, the default limitation 
      is 500 rows. My intention is to develop a paging mechanism which 
      will become available in the future versions.
    - Version change to 1.0.7
15-Apr-2006
    - Limitation in the number of rows can be turned off by setting it 
      to 0 or a negative value.
    - Tool do describe tables added to the "Misc" menu. Re-creation of 
      constraints doesn't work because of a bug in DBMS_METADATA. Version 9i
      cannot construct DDL for any constraint, 10G fails with foreign keys.
    - Version change to 1.0.8
29-May-2006
    - Fixed bug which has prevented foreign keys in "describe table" tool
      to work correctly.
    - Added V$SYS_TIME_MODEL to system events in the Instance section. This
      will only appear if the database version is at least 10.
    - Added V$SESS_TIME_MODEL to session info in the sessions section. This
      will only work if the database version is at least 10.
    - SQL Worksheet now can execute "alter session set current_schema" to 
      execute selects in another schema. For that, another entry was added to
      the "Connection" menu. The new entry name is "Schema To Exec SQL". It
      is constructed the same as other entries, with pattern to limit the 
      number of returned usernames.
    - Version change to 1.0.9
10-Jun-2006
    - Fixed bug which prevented sessions to show SQL and explain plan. The
      problem was in the RAW values which apparently cannot be passed as
      GET parameters. Oracle SQL function hextoraw fixes the problem.
    - This was also done for the expensive SQL menu.
    - Session menu can now sort by the allocated PGA. 
    - Session profile item in the "Session Info" menu will only appear
      in Oracle 10g.
    - Session is now started in a separate line, before the HTML headers
      are sent. This was done for all files, as the implementation on
      Windows 2000, with Apache 2.0.54 and PHP 5.1.4 was complaining.
    - Version change to 1.0.10
10-Jul-2006
    - Fixed bug using longops to show all sessions with the same sid.
      serial number is now also being used.
    - Added output buffering to schema_filter.php to counteract "headers
      already sent" problems on Win2k.
    - Added OBJECT_OWNER column to the execution plans. It was needed in
      the situations where several schemas had objects with the same names.
    - Started working on a decent paging system for the worksheet. 
05-Aug-2006
    - Changed the title to reflect the object name in DDL extraction 
      script, description script and data script. That will make window
      interfaces like GNOME and Windows XP show the table name on the 
      status bar.
    - Version change to 1.0.11
24-Aug-2006
    - Added submenu for logs, archives and DataGuard as a submenu of
      the "Instance" menu. I'm managing a DG configuration again and
      the tool is modified accordingly.
    - config.php now contains the function to make requesting database
      to have particular version easier.
    - DBA_Helper can now generate DDL for the Oracle's "dimension objects".
    - Basic information about histograms and buckets is added to the table
      description.
    - Generation of DB links was added to "Get DDL" menu. In Oracle9i, 
      passwords are clearly visible, while 10g uses "IDENTIFIED BY VALUES".
      Output format is HTML table.
    - Options to restrict the number of executions to consider in the
      "Expensive SQL" menu is added. Sometimes, the most expensive SQL is
      something like "select sysdate from dual", executed gazillion times. 
      While that definitely does reveal a design flaw, there are situations 
      in which we want to restrict the consideration to the statements with 
      only few executions.
    - Version change to 1.0.12
28-Aug-2006
    - Changed query, thrown out some columns that weren't needed and
      added the "SIZE" column which accurately reflects the size of the
      archive. Also, GV$ARCHVED_LOG is being used instead of V$ARCHIVED_LOG
      to help with RAC.
    - Redo log status now comes at the beginning of the file as it
      contains the information that I use most frequently. Also, RAC tables
      (GV$) are being used instead of the single instance tables.
    - Fixed some bugs with creating database scripts and ASM. The output is 
      still ugly, though.
03-Sep-2006
    - SGA stat now has pattern search which makes it possible to look
      for statistics with certain name pattern (hint: "free%").
    - Added buttons to switch and archive logs archived logs, under
      DG menu.
    - Added customized implementation of RMAN "list" commands, under
      the DG menu.
    - Worksheet and alert log now have rudimentary paging, no more "maxrows"
      nonsense. Default page size is 100 but that can be changed through the
      tool config menu.
    - Init.php script now queries the instance number and stores it as as
      session variable. This will be needed for RAC configurations. So far,
      none of other script uses this but I have a cunning plan....
    - All session scripts are beautified and made conformant to the programming
      style in the other scripts.
    - Version change to 1.0.13
17-Sep-2006
    - Table data got pagination. I forgot to do that before.
    - Resize file now buffers output.
    - Annoying title "Paritions" is now fixed into "Partitions" in 
      tab_info.php
14-Nov-2006
    - Listing and compilation of invalid objects added to the "Misc Info"
      menu
    - Database size is computed and is added to the Resources Info in the 
      instance menu
    - Version change to 1.0.14 
    - dba_helper.obj_info now returns URL to open in a new 
      window. That affects all of "get DDL" entries.
    - The "instance_info.php" script no longer shows the output from 
      V$DATABASE, it is now showing DBA_REGISTRY instead.
26-Nov-2006
    - Table description will now include triggers.
    - Invalid objects menu will now set the pattern to the owner of 
      the recompiled object, after the "recompile" link is used.
19-Dec-2006
    - Rounding added to Free Temp Space
    - Materialized views added to Get DDL menu.
    - Fixed bug which was causing "resize file" to return to the
      "Sessions by CPU" menu.
26-Dec-2006
    - ASM free space added to Files & Tablespaces menu.
10-Jan-2007
    - Script for searching sessions by SID or SPID now addedd to
      the "Sessions" menu.
04-Feb-2007
    - Script to search for objects based on GV$ACCESS table added to 
      the "Locks" menu.
    - Version change to 1.0.15. Many changes have been made, version
      change is justified.
09-Feb-2007
    - PHP 5.2.1 and ADOdb5 were used. No changes necesary, except
      in the config file.
04-Mar-2007
    - Four separate scripts in the schema menu have been replaced by a
      single script. This was programming at its worst, done in a hurry.
      Also, sessions can now be filtered so that only active sessions are
      shown.
22-Apr-2007
    - Version change to 1.0.16. 
    - Longops sorted by time remaining, DESC.
    - Session search now has many more criteria then SID and SPID. Also,
      now there is choice between equality and likeness search.
    - Archive logs and backup now make it possible to search by the date
      range. That is necessary when having to sift through many backups,
      looking just for the particular days.
29-Apr-2007
    - Fixed a long standing bug with logfile groups in the cr_dbs.php,
      a script that generates "CREATE DATABASE" command.. Logfile groups need
      not be a consecutive array of numbers. It is perfectly possible for
      a database to have logfile group numbers 10, 20 and 30, with nothing
      between them. Script to re-create the database should now work properly.
10-May-2007
    - Ability to search sessions through the entire RAC was added. It still
      doesn't display informations on the remote sessions. That is planned
      for some later time. For this to work, "SELECT ANY DICTIONARY" privilege
      needs to be granted directly to the user executing the tool.
12-May-2007
    - Show recyclebin command added to "Misc" menu. This is, clearly, 
      version 10 specific.
    - Session search now sorts by instance
    - Version change to 1.0.17
19-May-2007
    - There is an additional setup in the tool configuration to enable
      the bind values to be shown in the trace files. This is only enabled
      in version 10 and higher.
22-May-2007
    - Tab columns in the table info ("Table Description" menu, under "Misc")
      are now numerated by a rownum column.
23-May-2007
    - Status is now shown for indexes.
07-Jul-2007
    - Create user command was added to the "security" menu.
    - Users can now be dropped.
    - Version change to 1.0.18
04-Dec-2007
    - Backups can now be listed by date.
    - RMAN jobs can be monitored for Oracle 10g and above
    - Data Pump jobs can be monitored for Oracle 10g and above
    - Obsolete parameters are shown, if specified, in the instance->parameters
      menu
    - ASM Free space now shows flashback recovery area usage.
    - Bad bug was fixed in the tool config menu, which was preventing 
      default date format setting from taking place.
27-Dec-2007
    - RMAN job output can be monitored for each job.
    - DBA_SCHEDULER_JOBS and DBA_JOBS can be monitored from the
      misc menu.
    - Version change to 1.0.19
14-Jan-2008
    - Bind variable values can now be shown for Oracle9i as well.
05-Feb-2008
    - "Find Objects" submenu added to the Misc menu.
    - Number of sessions now reported beneath the "Sort Sessions" screens.
    - Fixed a bug in DBMS_HELPER package which prevented showing locked
      objects in the Lock Holders submenu
    - Enabled selecting lock holders by username, sid or both.
    - Version change to 1.0.20.
04-Mar-2008
    - Added dependencies view
    - Plan info changed to hopefully eliminate duplicates and use
      SQL_ID only.
    - Schedules are shown with the jobs (DBA_SCHEDULER_JOBS)
    - Version change to 1.0.21.
25-Mar-2008
    - System events now can be used to flush shared pool. The button is
      beneath the list of all events.
28-Mar-2008
    - YAML generation for the Symfony project is added. This tool can now
      describe table in a way that is compatible with Symfony's "schema.yml"
      file.
25-Apr-2008
    - YAML generation moved to standalone Perl script. 
    - AWR report generation added to the "Misc" menu.
    - Menus reorganized to be easier to read. The "Misc" menu was split
      into two menus.
    - Expensive SQL menus now show SQL ID for version 10+ so that the SQL
      statements from the AWR report can be located in the "Expensive SQL"
      menu.
    - version change to 1.0.22
20-JUN-2008
    - Number of returned records is moved to CSR2HTML function.
27-JUN-2008
    - Description of the suitable objects is added to both DDL re-creation
      and dictionary table descriptions.
    - Table list now shows compression.
    - Version change to 1.0.23
18-JUL-2008
    - Instance info now observes the configured NLS_DATE_FORMAT.
23-JUL-2008
    - Explain plan for the version 10G now uses DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY_CURSOR 
      instead of the custom made query for the version 9i.
11-AUG-2008
    - Pattern filtering is now possible for data files, too.
    - In table information page, basic statistics are now shown for 
      indexes. That can be used to figure out how likely is CBO to use
      that index and/or make the index more attractive.
12-AUG-2008
    - CSR2ASCII is now buffered to cut down on "print" requests.
    - Unnecessary circular "require" removed from CSR2ASCII
    - Security menu now offers to re-create the user 
    - Version change to 1.0.24
21-AUG-2008
    - Recycle bin entry now shows the recycle bin ordered by space
      consumption. The space is shown in MB.
01-OCT-2008
    - ER diagrams added to DB Objects section, "table info" menu.
    - It is now possible to look for objects being accessed by session
      in the "Locks" menu.
    - Version of "show SGA" is now put into the "Memory Statistics"
      item in the "Instance" section".
    - Version change to 1.0.25
11-DEC-2008
    - Role management added to the tool. 
24-DEC-2008
    - Adding data files is now possible for the "normal" tablespaces.
    - Searching archived logs by thread and sequence is now possible.
31-DEC-2008
    - The "time model" is replaced with the "session metric". Basic
      performance indicators are shown for the session.
    - Log files are now shown from V$LOG instead of GV$LOG. 
07-JAN-2009
    - Additional searching criteria enabled for both DBA jobs and
      scheduler jobs.
23-JAN-2009
    - Fixed bug with the title of "Re-Create User" page.
    - Select * from V$DATABASE added into the instance_info.php
    - Invalid objects can now be searched by type, on only by the
      owner.
    - Version change to 1.0.26
29-APR-2009
    - Added role membership control in "Manage Roles" screen. The "Grant Role"
      mask no longer goes to the basic DBA_Helper frame and the title is 
      changed.
30-APR-2009
    - Added trace analysis capability. This was done by using the free utility 
      called TRCANLZR and described in the Metalink note 224270.1. This utility
      exists for a long time and is compatible with every major datababase 
      release from 9.2.0 on. The utility has a PL/SQL interface, ideal for being
      called from PHP. 
03-MAY-2009
    - Added the OS CPU load monitoring to the instance menu. It's querying
      the GV$OSSTAT table. CPU load per instance is calculated as BUSY_TIME/
      IDLE_TIME and displayed below the stats listing.
04-MAY-2009
    - Added monitoring deltas from V$SESSMETRIC.  V$SESSMETRIC table contains
      the session indicators for a period of 1500 milliseconds. This is 
      extremely useful for monitoring sessions that is being the most active
      right now.
    - The items that were rarely used were removed from the Session Info mask.
    - Session info mask now shows the session ID on top of the page to avoid
      confusion when looking at 2 or more sessions.
    - ER diagram is now shown and saved as a PNG image, not SVG. That should
      make the output easier to handle, save and display.
   -  Version change to 1.0.27
15-MAY-2009
   - Added a rudimentary "Latches" screen to the lock menu. I used it to 
     to find out the latch referenced in V$SESSION_WAIT (by address).
29-AUG-2011
   - Many changes, this is the first version after a long time. It contains
     Oracle 11 goodies plus many other changes, too numerous to count.
15-DEC-2011
   - Trace file name is now being derived from a simple function in the 
     DBA_HELPER package. That function is much easier to modify for a 
     particular database than the original select. The function name is
     get_trace_file(:SID,:SERIAL) returns VARCHAR2 DETERMINISTIC. This was
     tested on two Oracle 11.2.0.3 instances, one RAC, one single instance.
11-FEB-2012     
   - Added job control functions for DBMS_SCHEDULER and Datapump. Both 
     scheduler jobs and datapump jobs can now be stopped, killed or restarted.
   - Latches screen was removed from the lock menu as it was completely 
     useless. Also, Oracle 11g uses completely different latches mechanism,
     latches are no longer as important or problematic as they used to be 
     in the previous versions.
   - Version change to 1.0.30  
02-APR-2012
   - Expensive SQL section rewritten. Now, the tool can show both cumulative
     and per execution SQL for the CPU, elapsed time and row processed. It 
     is now also possible to restrict the search on a single schema or schema
     pattern. This change doesn't warrant a version change.
26-JAN-2013
   - Fixed a problem with ER diagrams. The problem was caused by PEAR packages
     failing in PHP 5.4. The error reporting line had to turn off reporting 
     errors on all deprecated features.
